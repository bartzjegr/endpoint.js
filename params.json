In\r\naddition, a markdown file of all the markdown documentation will be placed in dist/endpoint-docs.pdf.\r\n\r\n    grunt docs\r\n\r\nTo run unit tests (with chrome only for now), use the following command. Coverage reports are in reports/coverage:\r\n\r\n    grunt test\r\n\r\nTo run integration tests (with chrome only for now), use the following commands. Logs are in reports/wdio:\r\n\r\n    grunt integration-setup\r\n    grunt integration\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nTo run the demos, use the following on the command line:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install\r\ngrunt demo\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen up a browser to one of the following examples:\r\n\r\n- [General Demo (Contains Sidebar, Map, and a simple 'Plot point' widget)](http://127.0.0.1:8282/plot-point/plot-point.html)\r\n- [API Example, including Stream](http://127.0.0.1:8282/general-api/general-api.html)\r\n- Distributed Chat Example [port 8282](http://127.0.0.1:8282/chat-server/chat-server.html) and [port 8283](http://127.0.0.1:8283/chat-server/chat-server.html)\r\n- [WebRTC Example](http://127.0.0.1:8282/chat-webrtc/chat-webrtc.html)\r\n- [Worker Pool Example](http://127.0.0.1:8282/worker-pool/worker-pool.html)\r\n- Cross Origin ([Plugin 1](http://localhost:8282/cross-origin/plugin1.html) at port 8282) and ([Plugin 2](http://localhost:8283/cross-origin/plugin2.html) at port 8283)\r\n- [Child Facade Example](http://127.0.0.1:8282/sub-facade/sub-facade.html)\r\n- [Authorization Example](http://127.0.0.1:8282/auth/auth.html) using child facades\r\n- [Node.js Child Process Example](http://127.0.0.1:8282/child-process/child-process.html)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, an example of Endpoint.js being run on the express server is provided in examples/app.js.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nAll pull request contributions to this project will be released under the Apache 2.0 or compatible license.\r\nSoftware source code previously released under an open source license and then modified by NGA staff is considered a\r\n\"joint work\" (see 17 USC &sect; 101); it is partially copyrighted, partially public domain, and as a whole is protected by\r\nthe copyrights of the non-government authors and must be released according to the terms of the original open source\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\n## Getting Support\r\n\r\nOur team is working to add a website and mailing list.
